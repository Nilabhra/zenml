# Scheduling Jobs

In production ML systems, it is some times required to set up scheduled jobs for various use-cases.

## Continuous Training

This feature is currently work in progress. While ZenML can easily be used to establish a continuous training scenario through outside triggers, a future release will bring native functionalities to support continuous training use cases.

## Setting up a scheduled BatchInference job

This feature is currently work in progress. However, ZenML can be easily integrated into existing schedulers. Feel free to hop on our [Slack](https://zenml.io/slack-invite), we'll be happy to help.

If you need any of these functionalities earlier, let us know via [Slack](https://zenml.io/slack-invite) or [create an issue on GitHub](https://https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml).
