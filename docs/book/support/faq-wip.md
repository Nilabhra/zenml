## Where do I specify my requirements?

Any requirement can be specified, just as you would normally do e.g. using a `requirements.txt` file. The only thing to take care of is not to clash with libraries ZenML itself comes installed. See a list of these [here](https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml/blob/main/setup.py#L53).
